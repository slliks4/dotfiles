# Development Tooling

This directory contains **development-related tools and environments**.

These tools are:
- used for programming and system work
- often version-sensitive
- part of the daily developer workflow
- sometimes managed outside the system package manager

Examples:
- language runtimes (C, Lua)
- editors and tooling
- shells and terminal tools
- version managers

Each tool is documented and installed independently,
allowing selective setup depending on the machine or purpose.

This separation ensures development tooling can evolve
without impacting system stability or everyday applications.
